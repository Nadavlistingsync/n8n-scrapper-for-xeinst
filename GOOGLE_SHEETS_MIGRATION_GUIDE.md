# 🚀 Complete Migration Guide: Supabase to Google Sheets

This guide will help you completely migrate from Supabase to Google Sheets without requiring any API setup.

## 📋 Overview

We've created a new database system that:
- ✅ Stores data in CSV files locally
- ✅ Exports data ready for Google Sheets import
- ✅ Maintains all existing functionality
- ✅ No API keys or complex setup required
- ✅ Automatic backups and analytics

## 🎯 Migration Steps

### Step 1: Migrate Data from Supabase

First, let's move your existing data from Supabase to the new system:

```bash
# Run the migration script
node scripts/migrate-supabase-to-google-sheets.js
```

This will:
- Fetch all your leads from Supabase
- Save them to CSV files
- Create backups
- Generate analytics reports

### Step 2: Test the New System

Verify everything is working correctly:

```bash
# Test the new Google Sheets database system
node scripts/test-google-sheets-db.js
```

This will test all database operations and confirm the migration was successful.

### Step 3: Export to Google Sheets

Create files ready for Google Sheets import:

```bash
# Export data in Google Sheets format
node scripts/export-to-google-sheets-simple.js
```

This creates multiple files:
- `leads-export-YYYY-MM-DD.csv` - Complete lead data
- `email-campaign-YYYY-MM-DD.csv` - Ready for email campaigns
- `analytics-YYYY-MM-DD.csv` - Analytics summary
- `emails-only-YYYY-MM-DD.txt` - Simple email list
- `emails-with-names-YYYY-MM-DD.txt` - Emails with usernames

### Step 4: Import to Google Sheets

1. Go to [Google Sheets](https://sheets.google.com)
2. Create a new spreadsheet
3. For each CSV file:
   - Go to **File > Import > Upload**
   - Select the CSV file
   - Choose **"Replace current sheet"** or **"Insert new sheet"**
   - Click **"Import data"**

### Step 5: Update Your Application

The API routes have already been updated to use the new system. Your web interface will now work with the Google Sheets database.

## 📊 What's Different

### Before (Supabase)
- Data stored in cloud database
- Requires API keys and setup
- Real-time synchronization
- Complex deployment requirements

### After (Google Sheets)
- Data stored locally in CSV files
- No API keys required
- Manual sync via CSV export/import
- Simple file-based system
- Automatic backups

## 🔄 Data Flow

```
GitHub Scraping → CSV Files → Google Sheets Import
     ↓
Web Interface ← CSV Files ← Google Sheets Export
```

## 📁 File Structure

After migration, you'll have:

```
data/
├── leads.csv                    # Main database file
├── backups/                     # Automatic backups
│   └── leads-backup-*.csv
├── leads-export-*.csv          # Google Sheets ready
├── email-campaign-*.csv        # Email campaign data
├── analytics-*.csv             # Analytics summary
├── emails-only-*.txt           # Simple email list
└── emails-with-names-*.txt     # Emails with usernames
```

## 🛠️ Available Scripts

### Migration Scripts
- `migrate-supabase-to-google-sheets.js` - Move data from Supabase
- `test-google-sheets-db.js` - Test the new system

### Export Scripts
- `export-to-google-sheets-simple.js` - Export to Google Sheets format
- `scrape.js` - Scrape new leads (now saves to CSV)
- `scrape-workflows.js` - Scrape n8n workflows (now saves to CSV)

### Management Scripts
- All existing scripts now work with the new system
- Data is automatically saved to CSV files
- Backups are created automatically

## 🔧 Configuration

No additional configuration needed! The system works with your existing environment variables:

```env
# GitHub API (still needed for scraping)
GITHUB_TOKEN=your_github_token_here

# Resend Email API (still needed for emails)
RESEND_API_KEY=your_resend_api_key_here

# OpenAI API (still needed for AI analysis)
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here
```

**Note**: You can remove Supabase environment variables after migration.

## 📈 Benefits

### ✅ Advantages
- **No API Setup**: No Google Sheets API configuration required
- **Simple**: Just CSV files and manual import/export
- **Reliable**: Local file storage with automatic backups
- **Flexible**: Easy to modify and extend
- **Portable**: Can move data between systems easily
- **Free**: No cloud database costs

### ⚠️ Considerations
- **Manual Sync**: Need to export/import for Google Sheets updates
- **Local Storage**: Data stored on your machine
- **No Real-time**: Changes aren't instantly synced to Google Sheets

## 🔄 Regular Workflow

### Daily Operations
1. **Scrape new leads**: `node scripts/scrape.js`
2. **Analyze with AI**: `node scripts/ai-analyze.js`
3. **Send emails**: Use the web interface or API
4. **Export to Google Sheets**: `node scripts/export-to-google-sheets-simple.js`

### Weekly Backup
1. Copy the `data/` folder to a backup location
2. Import updated CSV files to Google Sheets
3. Review analytics and campaign performance

## 🚨 Troubleshooting

### Migration Issues
```bash
# If migration fails, check your Supabase credentials
node scripts/test-db.js

# If no data found, verify your Supabase setup
# Check your .env.local file for correct credentials
```

### System Issues
```bash
# Test the new system
node scripts/test-google-sheets-db.js

# Check data directory
ls -la data/

# View recent backups
ls -la data/backups/
```

### Data Issues
```bash
# Export current data
node scripts/export-to-google-sheets-simple.js

# Check analytics
node -e "const { getAnalytics } = require('./lib/google-sheets-db'); getAnalytics().then(console.log)"
```
